_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     Computes confidence intervals for one or more parameters in a
     fitted model.  There is a default and a method for objects
     inheriting from class ‘"lm"’.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     confint(object, parm, level = 0.95, ...)
     ## Default S3 method:
     confint(object, parm, level = 0.95, ...)
     ## S3 method for class 'lm'
     confint(object, parm, level = 0.95, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

  object: a fitted model object.

    parm: a specification of which parameters are to be given
          confidence intervals, either a vector of numbers or a vector
          of names.  If missing, all parameters are considered.

   level: the confidence level required.

     ...: additional argument(s) for methods.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     ‘confint’ is a generic function.  The default method assumes
     normality, and needs suitable ‘coef’ and ‘vcov’ methods to be
     available.  The default method can be called directly for
     comparison with other methods.

     For objects of class ‘"lm"’ the direct formulae based on t values
     are used.

     There are stub methods in package ‘stats’ for classes ‘"glm"’ and
     ‘"nls"’ which call those in package ‘MASS’ (if installed): if the
     ‘MASS’ namespace has been loaded, its methods will be used
     directly.  (Those methods are based on profile likelihood.)

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A matrix (or vector) with columns giving lower and upper
     confidence limits for each parameter. These will be labelled as
     (1-level)/2 and 1 - (1-level)/2 in % (by default 2.5% and 97.5%).

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     ‘confint.glm’ and ‘confint.nls’ in package ‘MASS’.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     fit <- lm(100/mpg ~ disp + hp + wt + am, data = mtcars)
     confint(fit)
     confint(fit, "wt")
     
     ## from example(glm)
     counts <- c(18,17,15,20,10,20,25,13,12)
     outcome <- gl(3, 1, 9); treatment <- gl(3, 3)
     glm.D93 <- glm(counts ~ outcome + treatment, family = poisson())
     confint(glm.D93) # needs MASS to be installed
     confint.default(glm.D93)  # based on asymptotic normality
